Proximity-Verified Attendance App: Leveraging Android Studio and Java for Enhanced Student Accountability and Faculty Efficiency

Abstract:

This abstract introduces an attendance management application developed using Android Studio and Java, aimed at revolutionizing the traditional attendance tracking process in educational institutions. The application incorporates advanced features including QR code generation based on faculty-defined parameters such as location, date, and time, ensuring precise attendance records. Additionally, it utilizes GPS or Bluetooth technology to verify student proximity, thereby preventing proxy attendance.

Operating on a faculty-student model, faculty members generate unique QR codes for each class session, dynamically tailored to specific parameters. Students scan these codes upon entering the classroom using their mobile devices. The app, developed using Android Studio and Java, employs sophisticated algorithms to authenticate the QR code and validate student presence based on location proximity.

Furthermore, the application integrates a title table feature that seamlessly links to subject-specific Google Forms. Upon successful QR code verification, students gain access to the relevant Google Form for submitting assignments or feedback, enhancing classroom engagement and interaction.

By harnessing the power of Android Studio and Java, the attendance app offers a user-friendly interface for both faculty and students, facilitating efficient attendance management and fostering a culture of accountability. This abstract outlines the technological framework and innovative functionalities of the app, providing a robust solution for educational institutions seeking to optimize attendance tracking while upholding academic integrity.
